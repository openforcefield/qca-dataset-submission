# Description:

From Xinjun Hou at Pfizer, these are 100 small molecule fragments from e-Molecules that Pfizer found significant difference between their QM and OPLS3 torsion profiles -- that is, they are `problematic` fragments.

## Manifest:
- `PFE-OFF-100Frags.pdf`: Visualization of the 100 fragments
- `PFE-OFF-100Frags.smi.gz`: gzipped SMILES of the 100 fragments.
