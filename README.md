# OpenFF QCArchive Dataset Submission

## Dataset Lifecycle

All datasets submitted to QCArchive via this repository conform to the [Dataset Lifecycle](#the-lifecycle-of-a-dataset-submission).

See [STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md) for submission standards.
Datasets must be submitted as pull requests.

## User Quickstart

0. Ensure `git-lfs` is installed on your local machine: https://git-lfs.github.com/

1. To submit a new dataset, begin by cloning this repository:
   ```
   export GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1
   git clone git@github.com:openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission.git
   ```

   This will clone the repo, but avoid downloading existing LFS objects.
   If you wish to download all LFS objects, leave off the `export GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1`.


2. Once cloned, create and switch to a new branch from `master`,
   then create a new directory in `qca-dataset-submission/submissions/`:
   ```
   git checkout -b <dataset-branch>
   mkdir qca-dataset-submission/submissions/YYYY-MM-DD-OpenFF-<DESCRIPTIVE-DATASET-NAME>-v1.0
   ```
   You will add all submission artifacts to this directory.


3. Create and activate a new conda env with basic submission-preparation requirements with:
    ```
    conda env create -f qca-dataset-submission/devtools/prod-envs/qcarchive-user-submit.yaml
    conda activate qcarchive-user-submit
    ```
   You may also need to install OpenEye:\
   `conda install -c openeye openeye-toolkits`



4. Choose a starting notebook and README based on the type of dataset you wish to submit:
    - [`OptimizationDataset`](./examples/OptimizationDataset/)

   Copy the notebook and README for the dataset you want into the directory you created.

   ```
   cp examples/<dataset-type>/* qca-dataset-submission/submissions/YYYY-MM-DD-OpenFF-<DESCRIPTIVE-DATASET-NAME>-v1.0
   ```


5. Start up a Jupyter notebook with your new notebook:
    ```
    jupyter notebook qca-dataset-submission/submissions/YYYY-MM-DD-OpenFF-<DESCRIPTIVE-DATASET-NAME>-v1.0/generate-dataset.ipynb
    ```
   Edit the contents with appropriate metadata information,
   read in your molecules using the cells appropriate for your input data,
   and make any other modifications as needed for your specific needs.


6. Copy generated metadata components into README.
   Write a reasonably-detailed high-level description of the submission at the top.


7. Commit the following files in the submission directory you made:
    - your input files; please compress them if possible with e.g. `bzip2`
    - `generate-dataset.ipynb`
    - `dataset.pdf`
    - `dataset.smi`
    - `dataset.json.bz2`


8. Push your branch to Github:
    ```
    git push origin <dataset-branch>
    ```


9. Make a new PR for the branch.
   Validation will run automatically on your `dataset.json.*` file, indicating any potential issues prior to submission.
   Ask for help if you see validation failures you do not understand.
   Ping a reviewer in the comments.


10. Once reviewed and approved, your submission will be merged and submitted to QCArchive!
    Computations specified by the submission will be performed on OpenFF-managed compute resources.

### Creating a compute expansion
If you have already computed a dataset but want to re-compute it with a new `QCSpec` (e.g. new level of theory), you can do so using a compute expansion. This is faster than creating a new dataset, and explicitly links datasets with the same molecules and purpose.
A compute expansion involves adding a file called `compute.json` to your original submission, which contains the dataset metadata (identical to the original dataset) and the new compute spec.
This can be done manually, or programatically.
The programatic description is provided below, with an example of the notebook and of the file.

1. Create a new branch as described above, and navigate to the submission directory of the dataset you want to expand.
2. Create a new jupyter notebook called `generate-compute.ipynb` [example here](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/blob/master/submissions/2024-09-18-OpenFF-NAGL2-ESP-Timing-Benchmark-v1.1/generate-compute.ipynb).
3. In the notebook, either download the original dataset and remove the molecules and _original_ `QCSpec`, or re-create the dataset with the same name as the original and skip the molecule addition step.
* See below for details about how changes to the dataset are propagated; note that the dataset name must be the same, and changes to any metadata except `compute-tag` and the `QCSpec` will be ignored when submitting the compute expansion.
* Please note that the default `compute_tag` is `openff`; if you need to use a different one, please add it explicitly to the dataset at this step, as the `compute.json` file overrides the compute tag added manually to the PR. If you do need to change the compute tag after submission, you can change it by updating the label on the PR and the change will take effect when the error cycling action runs next.
4. Add the _new_ `QCSpec` to the dataset, and save the dataset to `compute.json`, example [here](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/blob/master/submissions/2024-09-18-OpenFF-NAGL2-ESP-Timing-Benchmark-v1.1/compute.json).
5. Add the additional compute spec to the submission's `README.md` file.
6. Add the `generate-compute.ipynb` and `compute.json` files to the submission's `QCSubmit Manifest` entry in the `README.md` file.
7. Proof the submission and open a PR. Dataset validation will run automatically.
8. Once the dataset is validated, request a review, and once approved, your compute expansion will be submitted!

When the PR is merged, the following happens:

* CI checks for `compute*.json*`, so files can be called anything so long as they follow that pattern.

* This gets loaded into a QCSubmit `dataset` structure in CI (see `lifecycle.py`, [`SubmittableBase`](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/blob/master/management/lifecycle.py#L333)) and submitted to MolSSI with [`openff.qcsubmit.datasets.datasets._BaseDataset.submit()`](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-qcsubmit/blob/main/openff/qcsubmit/datasets/datasets.py#L174)

* `submit()` checks if the dataset already exists using only the dataset type and name. Changes in descriptions, other metadata, etc. don't affect anything. New/different molecules will also be ignored if the dataset name already exists.

* `submit()` adds the specifications

* `submit()` submits with the `compute_tag` and `priority` within the new `compute.json`.

* Other info in the dataset, such as `dataset_tags`, are not incorporated into additional compute submissons and thus changing them will not affect the dataset.

# The Lifecycle of a Dataset Submission

All Open Force Field datasets submitted to QCArchive undergo well-defined *lifecycle*.

![Dataset Lifecycle](assets/lifecycle-diagram.png)

Each labeled rectangle in the lifecycle represents a *state*.
A submission PR changes state according to the arrows.
Changes in state may be performed by automation or manually by a human when certain critera are met.

The lifecycle process is described below, with [bracketed] items indicating the agent of action, one of:
- [GHA]: Github Actions
- [Board]: Github Project Board
- [Human]: A maintainer of the `qca-dataset-submission` repository.

1. A PR is created against `qca-dataset-submission` by a submitter.
    - the template is filled out with informational sections according to the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md)
    - [GHA]  `validation` operates on all `dataset*.json` files found in the PR; performs validation checks
        - comment made based on validation checks
        - reruns on each push

2. Add card for the PR to [Dataset Tracking](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1) board.
    - [Human]  add 'tracking' tag to PR
    - [GHA]  [`lifecycle-backlog`](.github/workflows/lifecycle-backlog.yml) will add card to ["Backlog"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577334) state for PR if not yet there.

3. When the submission is ready to be submitted to public QCArchive (validations pass, submitters and reviewers satisfied), PR is merged.
    - [Board]  PR card will move to state ["Queued for Submission"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577335) immediately.
    - [GHA]  [`lifecycle-backlog`](.github/workflows/lifecycle-backlog.yml) will move PR card to state ["Queued for Submission"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577335) if merged and in state ["Backlog"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577334)
    - [GHA]  [`lifecycle-submission`](.github/workflows/lifecycle-submission.yml) will attempt to submit the dataset
        - if successful, will move card to state ["Error Cycling"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577365); add comment to PR
        - if failed, will keep card queued; add comment to PR; attempt again next execution

    - [Human] Submit worker jobs on a server to begin compute. If using Nautilus, carefully monitor utilization and scale down resources as jobs finish.

4. COMPLETE, INCOMPLETE, ERROR numbers reported for `Optimizations`, `TorsionDrives`
    - [GHA]  [`lifecycle-error-cycle`](.github/workflows/lifecycle-error-cycle.yml) will collect the above statistics for state ["Error Cycling"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577365) PRs
        - will restart all errored `Optimizations` and `TorsionDrives`
        - will move PR to state ["Archived/Complete"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577372) if no ERROR, INCOMPLETE, all COMPLETE

5. PR will remain in state ["Error Cycling"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577365) until moved to ["Requires Scientific Review"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577358) or until all tasks COMPLETE
    - [Human]  if errors appear persistent,  move to state ["Requires Scientific Review"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577358)
    - discussion should be had on PR for next version
    - [Human]  once decided, state moved to ["End of Life"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577336)
    - [Human] ensure all worker jobs have been shut down.

6. [GHA]  `lifecycle-end-of-life` will add tag 'end-of-life' to dataset in QCArchive for PR in ["End of Life"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577336)

7. [GHA]  `lifecycle-archived-complete` will add tag 'archived-complete' to dataset in QCArchive for PR in ["Archived/Complete"](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1#column-9577372)

## Management Touchpoints

In addition to the states given above, there are additional touchpoints available for managing dataset submissions:

1. The `tracking` label is the "on/off" switch for automation via Github Actions.
   To disable all automation on a submission PR, remove this label.
   To enable automation, add the label.

2. Submission *priority* can be changed by adding one of the following labels:
    - `priority-high`: highest priority
    - `priority-normal`: normal priority
    - `priority-low`: lowest priority

3. Submission routing to QCFractal managers on different compute resources can be accomplished with *compute tags*.
   Add a label like `compute-<tagname>` to set the compute tag for all QCArchive tasks associated with a submisison.
   Be sure to coordinate with QCFractal manager admins to ensure your chosen compute tag is being served on the expected resources.
   This mechanism can also be used to "dead-letter" computations that are no longer desired by setting a compute tag that no manager will service.

4. The order of a submission PR in a [Dataset Tracking](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/projects/1) column matters.
   Submissions higher in a column will be operated on first by all Github Action automation.
   For example, if you want to error cycle a submission before any others so it has a higher chance of being pulled by idle manager workers, place it at the top of the Error Cycling column.


# Dude where's my Dataset?

Finding the source of a dataset in QCArchive can be difficult; here we offer a mapping between a dataset in QCArchive and the folder which contains its inputs including a quick overview of some metadata and the status of the dataset.
Note that new datasets submitted using QCSubmit know where they were created and have a `long_description_url` in the metadata which points directly to their home folder in this repository.

### Status
The status only refers to the `default` specification which is required for all of our datasets. Currently this is `B3LYP-D3BJ/DZVP`.

### Key:

[![Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-brightgreen)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-green) 100% of all default spec jobs have been complete.

[![Error](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Error-red)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Error-red)  some of the jobs in the dataset contain errors which may prevent the jobs from finishing, this could be something like a linear torsiondrive.

[![Running](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Running-orange)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Running-orange)  the dataset is currently running and may have some incomplete jobs.

We will scan the improper and proper angle simultaneously to better understand the coupling and energetics of these torsions. | O, C, S, H, N | [![Running](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Running-orange)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Running-orange)
| `OpenFF BCC Refit Study COH v2.0` | [2021-06-22-OpenFF-BCC-Refit-Study-COH-v2.0](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/tree/master/submissions/2021-06-22-OpenFF-BCC-Refit-Study-COH-v2.0) | A data set curated for the initial stage of the on-going OpenFF study which aims to co-optimize the AM1BCC bond charge correction (BCC) parameters against an experimental training set of density and enthalpy of mixing data points and a QM training set of electric field data. The initial data set is limited to only molecules composed of C, O, H. This limited scope significantly reduces the number of BCC parameters which must be retrained, thus allowing for easier convergence of the initial optimizations. The included molecules were combinatorially generated to cover a range of alcohol, ether, and carbonyl containing molecules. | O, C, S, H, N | [![Running](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Running-orange)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Running-orange)
