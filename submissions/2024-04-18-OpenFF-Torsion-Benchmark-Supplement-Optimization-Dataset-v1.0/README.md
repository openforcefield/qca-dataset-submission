# OpenFF Torsion Benchmark Supplement Optimization Dataset v1.0

## Description

An optimization data set created to expand the benchmarking data for both
existing Sage 2.2.0 proper torsion parameters and new parameters added through
the [torsion multiplicity][tm] project. The molecules in this data set were
selected from the [ChEMBL 33][chembl] database with additional processing steps
described below.

## General Information

## QCSubmit generation pipeline

* `generate-dataset.ipynb`: This notebook shows how the dataset was prepared
  from the input files: `all.smiles` and `tm-2.2.offxml` (Sage 2.2.0 release
  candidate with [torsion multiplicity][tm] changes applied).
* The list of proper torsion parameter ID and SMILES pairs in `all.smiles` were
  collected by searching the ChEMBL database for all of the molecules matching
  the parameters of interest, fragmenting these molecules with the
  [RECAP][recap] algorithm as implemented in RDKit, clustering them based on
  their 1024-bit [Morgan][morgan] fingerprints using the [DBSCAN][dbscan]
  algorithm, and taking the smallest molecules from these cluster centroids. The
  code used for all of these steps can be found [here][cura].
