---Judge bond type for Residue 1 with ID of 1 and Name of ACE ---

---Judge bond type for Residue 2 with ID of 2 and Name of CHI ---
Info: Bond types are assigned for valence state (3) with penalty (1).
Warning: Weird total charge (-11)!
         Assuming the net charge is 0.
         If the weird charge was correct, specify it via the -nc net charge flag.
