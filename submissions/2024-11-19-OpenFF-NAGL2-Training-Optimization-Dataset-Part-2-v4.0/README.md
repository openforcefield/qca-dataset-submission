# OpenFF NAGL2 Training Optimization Dataset Part 2 v4.0

## Description
A dataset containing molecules from the [`MLPepper RECAP Optimized Fragments v1.0`](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/tree/master/submissions/2024-07-26-MLPepper-RECAP-Optimized-Fragments-v1.0)
and [`MLPepper RECAP Optimized Fragments v1.0 Add Iodines`](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/tree/master/submissions/2024-10-11-MLPepper-RECAP-Optimized-Fragments-Add-Iodines-v1.0) datasets,
with additional conformers and optimized at the OpenFF default level of theory (B3LYP-D3BJ/DZVP).
The dataset is intended to be used for calculating single point energies and properties,
which will then be used to train our second-generation graph neural network charge model (NAGL2).
This is part 2, for molecules with molecular weight greater than 300 Da.


For each molecule, a set of up to 5 conformers were generated by:

  * generating a set of up to 1000 conformers with a RMS cutoff of 0.1 Ã…
using the OpenEye backend of the OpenFF toolkit

  * applying ELF conformer selection (max 5 conformers) using OpenEye
