# Biphenyl TorsionDriveDataset

### Description

Resubmission of `OpenFF Substituted Phenyl Set 1`, in response to metadata not being [stored in the places we need](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/pull/140#issuecomment-705675738) to use the dataset for MM reliably.

Description from original dataset below:

> - The original molecules were provided by Chris Bayly
> - The scripts and data to generate `phenyl_set_inputs.json` is [here](https://github.com/choderalab/fragmenter_data/blob/master/phenyl_benchmark/generate_torsiondrive_inputs.py)
> - Theory: OpenFF high-throughput standard QC reference
> - Additional Properties: Computes and saves Wiberg bond-orders

### QCSubmit generation pipeline

Extracting original molecules, conformers, and CMILES information; generating QCSubmit dataset:

- `Submission Preparation.ipynb`: This notebook shows how the Optimization dataset was prepared from the input files.

### QCSubmit Manifest

- `biphenyls_set_input.json`: original v1 submission molecules
- `phenyl_set_torsiondrive_inputs.json`: original v1 submission molecules
- `Submission Preparation.ipynb`: Dataset creation notebook with details on decisions made for submission.
- `molecules.pdf`: A pdf file containing molecule 2D structures, with driven torsions highlighted.
- `molecules.smi`: SMILES for every molecule in the submission.
- `dataset.json`: QCSubmit dataset submitted to QCArchive
