## Description

This is a single point energy calculation of pubchem set3 (5001-7500) molecules. Detailed description on how the data is generated can be found at https://github.com/openmm/qmdataset/tree/main/pubchem.

 v1.2 removes wavefunction storage, as this uses a substantial amount of space on public QCArchive and was not desired for this dataset.
