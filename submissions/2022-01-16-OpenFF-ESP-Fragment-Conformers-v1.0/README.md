# OpenFF ESP Fragment Conformers v1.0

### Description

A dataset that contains a diverse set of fragments generated from the [Enamine 10K and 50K diversity libraries](https://enamine.net/compound-libraries/diversity-libraries),
the curated [ZINC and ChEMBL (eps=78) molecules provided by Riniker and Bleiziffer](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/230799) 
and the `OpenFF Industry Benchmark Season 1 Public` molecule set.

The fragments were generated using the `Recap` decomposition scheme built in to `RDKit`

For each of the generated fragments a set of up to five conformers were generated by:

* generating a set of up to 500 conformers with an RMS cutoff of 0.5 Ã… using the OpenEye backend of the OpenFF 
  toolkit
* applying ELF conformer selection retaining only 5 conformers using the OpenEye backend of the OpenFF toolkit
* minimizing each conformer using psi4 and HF/6-31G* until the `GAU_LOOSE` convergence criteria have been met by 
  `geometric`.

The expectation is that the electrostatic potential and electric field can be computed using the wavefunction stored in
this dataset and using which new charge models can be trained.
