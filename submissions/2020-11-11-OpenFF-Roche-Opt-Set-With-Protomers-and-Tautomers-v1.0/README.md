### Description

This is an optimization dataset from Gen 1 fitting [https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/tree/master/submissions/2019-05-16-Roche-Optimization_Set]() with the protomers and tautomers enumerated.
Conformers were generated using a RMS cutoff of 3 Ã…ngstroms.

 - Purpose: Improve coverage of FF with addition of protonation states and tautomers
 - Collection: OptimizationDataset
 - Name: OpenFF Roche Opt Set With Protomers and Tautomers v1.0
 - Number of unique molecules: 1043

### QCSubmit generation pipeline

```
./01.run-qcsubmit.ipynb
```
`OpenFF_references.sdf.tar` contains the sdf file with 1043 molecules 
QCSubmit was used to filter duplicate SMILES, enumerate protomers, tautomers, and generate conformers. 

### QCSubmit Manifest
 
- `OpenFF_references.sdf.tar`: The initial molecule inputs containing the 3D structures
- `01.run-qcsubmit.ipynb`: The commands needed setup and run QCSubmit to create the submission.
