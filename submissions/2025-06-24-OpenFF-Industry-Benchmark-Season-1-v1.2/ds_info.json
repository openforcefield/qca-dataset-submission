    "description": "This dataset is the public counterpart of the OpenFF Industry Benchmark Season 1. Each industry partner has selected a range of diverse molecules which represent their current chemical interests. The dataset will be used in conjunction with private counterparts also designed by each partner to give an unbiased assessment of the progress and current performance of the OpenFF line of force fields in comparison with other contemporary force fields.\nThe v1.1 dataset features corrected Merck (MRK) molecules with explicit hydrogens. The original v1.0 dataset did not have explicit hydrogens on these molecules, resulting in poor starting conformers that have largely failed to geometry optimize under QM.\nThe v1.1 dataset was prepared from the v1.0 dataset, excising the MRK molecules and replacing them with the explicit hydrogen variants prepared using the [Season 1 protocol](https://openforcefield.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PS/pages/971898891/Optimization+Benchmarking+Protocol+-+Season+1) via `openff-benchmark`.\nThis v1.2 dataset has removed a subset of structures from v1.1 that exhibited unrealistic angles, which proved to hinder progress in converging force field parameters. The outlier records are recorded in the [sage-2.2.0 repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/sage-2.2.0/blob/main/05_benchmark_forcefield/process_bm/problem_ids/all_r7_outliers.txt).",
