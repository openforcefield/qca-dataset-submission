# OpenFF Protein Peptide Fragments unconstrained

### Description

This is a protein fragment dataset consisting of optimizations on various protein fragments prepared by David Cerutti.
We have 12 central residues capped with a combination of different terminal residues.

Details from David Cerutti, referring to motivations for these selections:

> The way it's set up, we are scanning phi and psi of the central residue with a random selection of ALA, GLY, SER, or VAL to the N- or C-terminus,
> and the customary ACE and NME blocking groups outside of that.

### General Information

 - Date: 2020.10.27
 - Class: OpenFF Optimization
 - Purpose: Optimizations for common amino acids
 - Collection: OptimizationDataset
 - Name: OpenFF Protein Peptide Fragments unconstrained v1.0
 - Number of unique molecules: 185
 - Number of optimizations: 6709
 - Submitter: David Dotson
 
Note, each folder contains molecules saved via mol2 in each conformation; however, the bond order is incorrect.
We let openeye interpret it by re-saving to PDB first before creating the dataset.
