# OpenFF Additional Generated Guanidine Amidine Derivative and O-Linker TorsionDrives 4.0

## Description

Molecules generated to add more coverage for the rare torsions t18b (matching amidine derivatives), t87a (matching guanidines derivatives), and t101 (matching O-linkers) in Sage 2.2.1.
Molecules were generated by hand to match rare patterns with the elements C, N, O, H.
10 molecules were generated per torsion, as shown in `inputs/generate-smiles.ipynb`.
