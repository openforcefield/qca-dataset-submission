# OpenFF Torsion Multiplicity Optimization Training Coverage Supplement v1.0

## Description
An optimization data set created to improve the coverage of both existing Sage
2.2.0 proper torsion parameters and new parameters added through the torsion
multiplicity project. The molecules in this data set were partly selected from
the ChEMBL 33 database and partly generated manually to match parameters not
covered by ChEMBL.

## QCSubmit Generation Pipeline
* `generate-dataset.ipynb`: This notebook shows how the dataset was prepared
from the input files: `train.opt.smi` and `ff.offxml`.

* The list of proper torsion parameter ID and SMILES pairs in `train.opt.smi`
were collected by searching the ChEMBL database for all of the molecules
matching the parameters of interest. The code used for all of these steps can be
found [here][frag].

## QCSubmit Manifest
