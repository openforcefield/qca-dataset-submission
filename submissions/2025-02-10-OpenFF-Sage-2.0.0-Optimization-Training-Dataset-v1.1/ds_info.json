    "description": "A quantum chemical (QC) dataset curated to train the OpenFF 2.0.0 Sage, with reparametrized Lennard-Jones (LJ) and valence parameters, the latter relevant to this dataset. This QC dataset with the OpenFF default level of theory, B3LYP-D3BJ/DZVP, is used to benchmark Sage geometries and energetics. These optimized conformer geometries were used in conjunction with the QC dataset used to train one dimensional torsional profiles. This Generation 2 dataset increases chemical diversity when compared to Generation 1, which are of value to our industry partners. Large molecules (>20 heavy atoms) were also included, offering more flexible molecules and a greater degree of conformational variation which provide intramolecular interactions. This is the complete Optimization dataset used for training OpenFF 2.0.0 Sage, consisting of the following datasets: OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 1 Roche', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 2 Coverage', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 3 Pfizer Discrepancy', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 4 eMolecules  - Discrepancy', and 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 5 Bayer'. The filters were applied: following filters were applied: RecordStatusFilter(status=RecordStatusEnum.complete), ConnectivityFilter(tolerance=1.2), UndefinedStereoFilter(), ConformerRMSDFilter(max_conformers=10), and ElementFilter(allowed_elements=['H', 'C', 'N', 'O', 'S', 'P', 'F', 'Cl', 'Br', 'I']). Further information can be found in the curation scripts for the linked repositories.",
