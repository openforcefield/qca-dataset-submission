# OpenFF Torsion Drive Supplement v1.0

## Description

A torsion drive data set created to expand the training data for both existing
Sage 2.2.0 proper torsion parameters and new parameters added through the
[torsion multiplicity][tm] project. The molecules in this data set were designed
manually to match the necessary parameters and to minimize chemical diversity in
the rest of the molecule.

## General Information

## QCSubmit generation pipeline

* `generate-dataset.ipynb`: This notebook shows how the dataset was prepared
  from the input files: `all.smiles` and `tm-2.2.offxml` (Sage 2.2.0 release
  candidate with [torsion multiplicity][tm] changes applied).
* The list of proper torsion parameter ID and SMILES pairs in `all.smiles` were
  generated by building SMILES that matched the desired parameter IDs and
  filling the rest of the molecule with methyl groups or other short carbon
  chains.

## QCSubmit Manifest

* `dataset.json.bz2`: Compressed dataset ready for submission
* `dataset.pdf`: Visualization of dataset molecules
