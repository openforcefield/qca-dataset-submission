## QCSubmit Generation procedure

- `openff_protein_capped_3-mer_backbones.ipynb`: This notebook shows how the dataset was prepared from the input files
    - Initial conformations were generated from SMILES using the OpenEye Toolkit
    - Sidechain dihedrals scanned using the OpenEye Toolkit
    - Conformers were minimized with the OpenFF 2.0.0 (Sage) force field using OpenMM
    - Minimized conformers were screened by changes in connectivity and in tetrahedral geometry around tetravalent atoms

## QCSubmit Manifest

- `dataset.json.bz2`: Compressed dataset ready for submission
- `dataset.pdf`: Visualization of 2D graphs for dataset molecules with driven torsions highlighted
- `dataset.smi`: Smiles strings for dataset molecules
- `capped_3mer_conformations` contains SDF files with conformers scanning phi and psi for capped 3-mers both before and after minimization
- `openff_protein_capped_3-mer_backbones.ipynb`: Notebook describing dataset generation and submission
