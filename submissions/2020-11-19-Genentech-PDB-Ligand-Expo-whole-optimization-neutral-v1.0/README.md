### Description

This is the first of the Genentech PDB Ligand Expo Dataset referenced here (https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/pull/48).
This contains neutral molecules and with number of rotors less than or equal to three.
Filtering for rotors brings down the original set to nearly 20% of its size (considering the initial number of molecules before conformer generation ).
Conformers were generated using a RMS cutoff of 3 Ã…ngstroms.

### General Information

### QCSubmit generation pipeline

```
./01.run-qcsubmit.ipynb
```

`../2019-09-05-Genentech-Optimization-Set/pubLigsNeutralGoodDensity.sdf` is the SDF file used as input

QCSubmit was used to filter duplicate SMILES, leave out molecules with # of rotors > 3, enumerate stereoisomers, and to generate conformers. 

### QCSubmit Manifest
 
- `../2019-09-05-Genentech-Optimization-Set/pubLigsNeutralGoodDensity.sdf`: The initial molecule inputs containing the 3D structures
- `01.run-qcsubmit.ipynb`: The commands needed setup and run QCSubmit to create the submission.
