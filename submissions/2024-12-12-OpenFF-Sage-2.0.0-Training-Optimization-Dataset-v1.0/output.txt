* Description: A quantum chemical (QC) dataset curated to train OpenFF 2.0.0 Sage, with reparametrized Lennard-Jones (LJ) and valence parameters, the latter relevant to this dataset. This QC dataset with the OpenFF default level of theory, B3LYP-D3BJ/DZVP, is used to benchmark Sage geometries and energetics. These optimized conformer geometries where used in conjunction with the QC dataset used to train one dimensional torsional profiles. This Generation 2 dataset increases chemical diversity when compared to Generation 1, which are of value to our industry partners. Large molecules (>20 heavy atoms) were also included, including more flexible molecules and a greater degree of conformational variation which provide intramolecular interactions.

This is the complete optimization dataset used for training OpenFF 2.0.0 Sage, consisting of the following datasets: 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 1 Roche', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 2 Coverage', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 3 Pfizer Discrepancy', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 4 eMolecules  - Discrepancy', and 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 5 Bayer'.
The following filters were applied: RecordStatusFilter(status=RecordStatusEnum.complete), ConnectivityFilter(tolerance=1.2), UndefinedStereoFilter(), ConformerRMSDFilter(max_conformers=10), and ElementFilter(allowed_elements=['H', 'C', 'N', 'O', 'S', 'P', 'F', 'Cl', 'Br', 'I'])Further information can be found in the curation scripts for the linked repositories.
* Purpose: B3LYP-D3BJ/DZVP conformers applicable to drug-like molecules for OpenFF 2.0.0 Sage
* Name: OpenFF Sage 2.0.0 Training Optimization Dataset v1.0
* Number of unique molecules: 1025
* Number of filtered molecules: 0
* Number of conformers: 3663
* Number of conformers (min, mean, max): 1.00, 3.53, 10.00
* Molecular weight (min, mean, max): 76.05, 261.38, 544.64
* Charges: -2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0
