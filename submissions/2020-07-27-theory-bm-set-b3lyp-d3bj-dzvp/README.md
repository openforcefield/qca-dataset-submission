### Description

This is a TorsionDrive dataset consisting of 36 1-D torsions selected for benchmarking different QM levels.


### Torsion selection scheme 
1. Consideration of the coverage of chemical diversity

- Variations in central bonds, formal charges, element compositions, intramolecular interactions;

- Inclusion of molecules (1) w/ non-zero formal charges, (2) w/ strong internal interactions, (3) w/ central bond conjugated( < 10 kcal/mol rotational barrier) or (4) w/ halogen

2. Consistency in molecular size
