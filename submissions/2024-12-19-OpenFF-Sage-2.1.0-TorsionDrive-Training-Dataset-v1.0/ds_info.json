    "description": "A quantum chemical (QC) dataset of single point energies and properties was curated to train sage OpenFF 2.1.0 Sage. This QC dataset with the OpenFF default level of theory, B3LYP-D3BJ/DZVP, is used to benchmark Sage geometries and energetics. This is the complete TorsionDrive dataset used for training OpenFF 2.0.0 Sage, consisting of the following datasets: 'OpenFF Gen 2 Torsion Set 1 Roche 2', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Torsion Set 2 Coverage 2', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Torsion Set 3 Pfizer Discrepancy 2', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Torsion Set 4 eMolecules Discrepancy 2', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Torsion Set 5 Bayer 2', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Torsion Set 6 supplemental 2', 'SMIRNOFF Coverage Torsion Set 1', 'OpenFF Group1 Torsions', 'OpenFF Group1 Torsions 2', 'OpenFF Group1 Torsions 3', 'Pfizer discrepancy torsion dataset 1', 'OpenFF Gen3 Torsion Set v1.0', 'OpenFF Amide Torsion Set v1.0', 'OpenFF WBO Conjugated Series v1.0', and 'OpenFF DANCE 1 eMolecules t142 v1.0'. These combined datasets were filtered with `ElementFilter(allowed_elements=['H', 'C', 'N', 'O', 'S', 'P', 'F', 'Cl', 'Br'])`, `HydrogenBondFilter(method='baker-hubbard')`, and `ChargeCheckFilter()`.",
