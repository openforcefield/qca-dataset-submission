### Description

This provides an optimization dataset based on an initial batch of [Jordan Ehrman's analysis of eMolecules](https://zenodo.org/record/3385278#.XXMdLZNKjOQ), pulling out molecules with minimized geometries which are substantially different in different force fields. While Ehrman will likely ultimately identify additional molecules that are particularly informative, this provides a first batch of 9,000 compounds. Here we retain only those with < 3 rotatable bonds which gives us 1,117 compounds.

### Manifest
- `informative_mols.csv`: Initial dataframe provided by Ehrman with SMILES for informative molecules.
- `01_visualize_and_filter.py`: Process `informative_mols.csv` and generate a visualization of the molecules; also extract those with less than three rotatable bonds for subsequent use.
- `optimization_inputs_filtered.pdf`: Visualization of compounds generated by `01_visualize_and_filter.py`
- `selected.smi`: The selected compounds, with fewer than 3 rotatable bonds.


### QCSubmit update 
As a test of qcsubmit an optimization dataset has been created starting from the `selected.smi` molecules.

### Generation pipeline
- `QCSubmit workflow.ipynb`: This notebook shows how the optimization dataset was prepared from the input smiles file. 

### QCSubmit Manifest
- `QCSubmit workflow.ipynb`: Dataset creation notebook
- `informative_optimization_dataset.json`: The optimization dataset ready for submission.
- `informative_settings.yaml`: The QCSubmit settings used to generate the optimization dataset.
