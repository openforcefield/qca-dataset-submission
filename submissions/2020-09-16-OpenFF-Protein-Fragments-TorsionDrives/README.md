# OpenFF Protein Fragments TorsionDrives

### Description

This is a protein fragment dataset consisting of torsion drives on various protein fragments prepared by David Cerutti.
We have 12 central residues capped with a combination of different terminal residues.
We drive the following angles for each fragment:
- omega
- phi
- psi
- chi1 (if applicable)
- chi2 (if applicable)

Details from David Cerutti:

> The way it's set up, we are scanning phi and psi of the central residue with a random selection of ALA, GLY, SER, or VAL to the N- or C-terminus,
> and the customary ACE and NME blocking groups outside of that.


### General Information

 - Date: 2020.09.16
 - Class: OpenFF TorsionDrive
 - Purpose: TorsionDrive scans for common amino acids

Note, each folder contains molecules saved via mol2 in each confirmation; however, the bond order is incorrect.
We let openeye interpret it by re-saving to PDB first before creating the dataset.
