    "description": "A quantum chemical (QC) dataset of single point energies and properties was curated to train sage OpenFF 2.1.0 Sage. This QC dataset with the OpenFF default level of theory, B3LYP-D3BJ/DZVP, is used to benchmark Sage geometries and energetics. This is the complete optimization dataset used for training OpenFF 2.0.0 Sage, consisting of the following datasets: 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 1 Roche', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 2 Coverage', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 3 Pfizer Discrepancy', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 4 eMolecules Discrepancy', 'OpenFF Gen 2 Opt Set 5 Bayer', 'OpenFF Gen2 Optimization Dataset Protomers v1.0', 'OpenFF Iodine Chemistry Optimization Dataset v1.0', 'OpenFF Optimization Set 1', 'SMIRNOFF Coverage Set 1', and 'OpenFF Aniline Para Opt v1.0'. These combined datasets were filtered with `ElementFilter(allowed_elements=['H', 'C', 'N', 'O', 'S', 'P', 'F', 'Cl', 'Br'])`, `RecordStatusFilter(status=RecordStatusEnum.complete)`, `ConnectivityFilter(tolerance=1.2)`, `UnperceivableStereoFilter()`, `ConformerRMSDFilter(max_conformers=12)`,and `ChargeCheckFilter()`.",
