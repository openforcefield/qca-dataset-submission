### Description

This is a Constrained Optimization dataset for benchmarking MP2/heavy-aug-cc-pVTZ. This takes the final optimized geometries from the default-spec torsiondrives at https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/tree/master/submissions/2020-12-18-OpenFF-Theory-Benchmarking-Set-v1.0 and performs the optimizations at this higher level of theory. In version 1.0 864 constrained optimizations corresponding to 36 trosiondrives are submitted. In addition to that 23 more torsion scans are added to the benchmark set and v1.1 includes those.
