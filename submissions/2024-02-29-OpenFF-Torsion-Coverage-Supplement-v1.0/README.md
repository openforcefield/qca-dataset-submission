# OpenFF Torsion Coverage Supplement v1.0

## Description

A torsion drive data set created to improve the coverage of both existing Sage
2.1.0 proper torsion parameters and new parameters added through the [torsion
multiplicity][tm] project. The molecules in this data set were selected from the
[ChEMBL 33][chembl] database with additional processing steps described below.

## General Information

* Number of unique molecules: 43
* Number of filtered molecules: 0
* Number of conformers: 43
* Number of conformers (min, mean, max): 1, 1.88, 7
* Mean molecular weight: 202.95
* Max molecular weight: 431.57
* Charges: [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
* Dataset submitter: Brent Westbrook

## QCSubmit generation pipeline

* `generate-dataset.ipynb`: This notebook shows how the dataset was prepared
  from the input files: `all.smiles` and `tm.v2.offxml`.
* The list of proper torsion parameter ID and SMILES pairs in `all.smiles` were
  collected by searching the ChEMBL database for all of the molecules matching
  the parameters of interest, fragmenting these molecules with the
  [RECAP][recap] algorithm as implemented in RDKit, clustering them based on
  their 1024-bit [Morgan][morgan] fingerprints using the [DBSCAN][dbscan]
  algorithm, and taking the two smallest molecules from these cluster centroids.
  The code used for all of these steps can be found [here][chembl-search].
