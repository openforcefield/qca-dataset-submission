# OpenFF multi-Br ESP Fragment Conformers v1.0

## Description

A dataset containing fragments of molecules from the Zinc, enamine, and CHEMBL datasets, optimized at the HF/6-31G* level of theory. Molecules containing I were fragmented into small fragments. 
Fragments containing I then had protomers enumerated.

For each resulting molecule, a set of up to 5 conformers were generated by:
  * generating a set of up to 1000 conformers with a RMS cutoff of 0.5 Ã… using the OpenEye backend of the OpenFF toolkit
  * applying ELF conformer selection (max 5 conformers) using OpenEye

Each conformer will be converged according to the 'GAU_LOOSE' criteria.
