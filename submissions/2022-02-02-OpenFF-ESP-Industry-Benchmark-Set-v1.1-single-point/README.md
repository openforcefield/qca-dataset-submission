# OpenFF ESP Industry Benchmark Set v1.1

### Description

A dataset containing molecules from the `OpenFF Industry Benchmark  Season 1 v1.1` molecule set, minus any that failed
conformer generation with the OpenEye toolkit, with ELF conformers. For each of the molecule, a set of up to five 
conformers were generated by:
 
* generating a set of up to 500 conformers with an RMS cutoff of 0.5 Ã… using the OpenEye backend of the OpenFF toolkit
* applying ELF conformer selection using the OpenEye backend of the OpenFF  toolkit 

Each conformer will be converged according to the 'GAU_LOOSE' criteria.

#### Change log

* v1.0: Initial submission
* v1.1: Create basic set from optimised conformers, pruning any whose connectivity changed after optimisation
