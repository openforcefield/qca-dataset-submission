# OpenFF Additional Generated Guanidine and Amidine Derivative TorsionDrives 4.0

## Description

Molecules generated to add more coverage for the rare torsions t18b (matching amidine derivatives) and t87a (matching guanidines derivatives) in Sage 2.2.1.
Charged molecules were generated by hand to match rare patterns with the elements C, N, O, H.
10 molecules were generated per torsion, as shown in `inputs/generate-smiles.ipynb`.
